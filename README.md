# 2018-Krembil-Institute

This repository is made for the work I have done for summer research at the Krembil Research Institute (Toronto Western Hospital) during the summer of 2018. 

The main focus of our project was to develop machine learning models that can predict transcription factor (TF)-DNA interactions better than traditional wet lab experiments can. This has significance since that the ability to accurately predict TF-DNA pairs can help with identifying certain pathways which cancer is propagated.
