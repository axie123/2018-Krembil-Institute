# Linear Models

The most promising linear model based on the graphs in the master branch tells us that the Logistic Regression was the most promising as it shows the greatest difference between the experimental data (green dots) and the computer generated models. 

The Lasso and Ridge regressions did not produce the same successes and they don't differ too much from each other in overall performance.
